The extensive investigation carried out between November 2017 and the end of January 2018 at the UNESCO site of Al-Khutm (Bat) has allowed to uncover an important complex dated back to the end of third Millennium BC, whose state of conservation and monumentality is unique among the towers so far investigated in Oman. 
As agree between the Ministry of Heritage and Tourism of the Sultanate of Oman and the university of Bologna it started a new excavation around the perimeter wall located in the western side of the tower. 
Questo Progetto a vari obbiettivi. Il primo obbiettivo è esporre completamente tutta l’altezza del muro al fine di evidenziare la monumentalità della torre. Conseguentemente, esporre il muro dalle basi, ci permette di comprendere meglio le fasi di costruzione e di vita della torre, a partire dal primo momento dalle fasi più antiche. 
Infatti si sono messe in luce varie fasi di frequentazione della torre con probabili evidenze di cantierizzazione del muro perimetrale nella sua prima fase di costruzione. Questa prima campagna di scavo archeologico ci ha permesso di indagare i primi 20 m del muro perimetrale evidenziando un’altezza massima di 2.80 m (Fig.1). 
Inoltre questa campagna ci ha permesso di fare anche alcune considerazioni, alla luce del restauro recentemente fatto su tutta la torre, che potrebbero migliorare la visibilità e la fruizione turistica del complesso archeologico.
